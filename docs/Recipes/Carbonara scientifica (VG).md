## Ingredients
* 2 egg yolks pp
* 10g Parmigiano Reggiano pp
* 7g Pecorino romano pp
* 30g Vegan lardons pp
* Black pepper

## Preparation
The trick is in the procedure to prepare the egg yolks. I used the method described in [this video](https://youtu.be/6mcEUySwS1c?t=814) (auto-translation of the captions works quite well), note that the ingredients weights I use are slightly different than the one in the video.
