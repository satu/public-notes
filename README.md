This repository contains notes written by me and meant to be shared with the public.

Notes written here are supposed to be published in a nice digital garden.

Not much to add for now, mostly experimenting with using Obsidian as a personal journal system.

Next step is to be able to publish these public notes in a website a-la Digital Garden.
